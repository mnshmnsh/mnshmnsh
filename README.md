# 🌐 Quantum Computing Portfolio — Hisham Mansour

This repository serves as a **central portfolio** linking my quantum computing projects, hackathon submissions, and algorithm-development work.  
Each project is kept in its original submitted form, and this repository acts as the unified entry point for professional audiences.

## 🚀 Highlight Projects

### **1. Quantum Galton Board — Womanium Global Quantum Hackathon 2025**  
🔗 **Repo:** https://github.com/mnshmnsh/Womanium2025--QuantumGaltonBoard  
Implementation of Carney & Varcoe’s *Universal Statistical Simulator*, reproducing classical and quantum Galton-board distributions using quantum circuits. Includes noise modeling, IBM hardware results, and error-mitigation experiments.

---

### **2. Classiq AztecHacks 2024 — Quantum Hackathon**  
🔗 **Repo:** https://github.com/mnshmnsh/Classiq-AztecHacks-2024-Quantum-Hackathon  
Solo 48-hour sprint solving all challenge tasks using the Classiq SDK. Includes W₃ Werner-state generation, multi-qubit arithmetic, and resource-aware circuit synthesis.

---

### **3. Quantum Utility & Error Mitigation — 2D Ising Model**  
🔗 **Repo:** https://github.com/mnshmnsh/Development-of-Novel-Quantum-Algorithms  
QAOA and Trotterized 2D Ising simulation with artificial noise injection. Ground-state energy recovered via Zero-Noise Extrapolation (ZNE), inspired by Kim et al., *Nature* (2023). Includes benchmarking and Classiq-based circuit-generation utilities.

## 📌 Purpose of This Repository  
This top-level repo acts as a **single pinned portfolio** for:

- LinkedIn  
- CVs and academic profiles  
- Hackathon and application submissions  
- Long-term consolidation of quantum projects  

The detailed codebase remains unchanged inside each individual project repository.
