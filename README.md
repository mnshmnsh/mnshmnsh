# 🌐 Quantum Computing Portfolio — Hisham Mansour

This repository serves as a **central portfolio** linking my quantum computing projects, hackathon submissions, and algorithm-development work.  
Each project is kept in its original submitted form, and this repository acts as the unified entry point for professional audiences.
